                <h3>Crypto currencies?</h3>
                <p>Crypto currency, also known as digital currency, is a type of currency that exists only in digital
                    form and uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions. It operates independently of a central
                    bank or government and is based on decentralized technology called blockchain.</p>
                <p>Crypto currencies use a peer-to-peer network to facilitate transactions between users directly
                    without the need for intermediaries like banks. This means that transactions can be processed more
                    quickly and at lower fees compared to traditional banking systems.</p>
